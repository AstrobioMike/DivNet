It's always easy to do things the way we've always done them. We've always estimated diversity indicies using multinomial models, a.k.a., by just plugging in the observed relative abundances to the formula
$-\sum_{i=1}^Q p_i \log p_i$
in the case of the Shannon diversity. However, multinomial models are a very poor fit to microbiome data. This vignette is intended to illustrate this fact.
  
## Microbiome data versus multinomial data

We're going to think about biological replicates for now, and how variable they can be. 


```{r}
counts <- c(10, 20, 30, 10, 1, 100)
my_mu <- counts/sum(counts)
(c(exp(my_mu), 1)/(c(exp(my_mu), 1) %>% sum)) %>% round(digits = 2)

qq <- my_mu %>% length
n <- 4

mu <- matrix(my_mu, nrow=n, ncol=qq, byrow=TRUE)

## 
set.seed(180314)
my_sigma_0 <- matrix(0, nrow=qq, ncol = qq)
A <- runif(qq^2, -1, 1) %>% matrix(nrow = qq)
D <- diag(c(10, 1, 1, 2, 0.1, 0.1))
my_sigma_1 <- A%*%D%*%t(A)

w1 <- make_w(mu, my_sigma_1, mm = rep(200, 6))
w0 <- make_w(mu, my_sigma_0, mm = rep(200, 6))
rownames(w1) <- paste("Sample", 1:n, "")
colnames(w1) <- paste("Taxon", 1:(qq+1), "")
rownames(w0) <- rownames(w1)
colnames(w0) <- colnames(w1)
w1
w0
```
